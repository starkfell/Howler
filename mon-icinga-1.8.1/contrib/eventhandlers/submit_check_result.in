# SUBMIT_CHECK_RESULT
# Written by Ethan Galstad (egalstad@nagios.org)
# Modified by Icinga Development Team (https://dev.icinga.org)
#
# This script will write a command to the Icinga command
# file to cause Icinga to process a passive service check
# result.  Note: This script is intended to be run on the
# same host that is running Icinga.  If you want to 
# submit passive check results from a remote machine, look
# at using the nsca addon.
#
# Arguments:
#  $1 = host_name (Short name of host that the service is
#       associated with)
#  $2 = svc_description (Description of the service)
#  $3 = return_code (An integer that determines the state
#       of the service check, 0=OK, 1=WARNING, 2=CRITICAL,
#       3=UNKNOWN).
#  $4 = plugin_output (A text string that should be used
#       as the plugin output for the service check)
#
