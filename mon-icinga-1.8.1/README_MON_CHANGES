12.01.2012 - [R. Irujo]
	   - v1.0
	   - Build has been upgraded from Icinga 1.5.1 to Icinga 1.8.1.
	   - A plethora of changes were made as detailed below. The Version Numbering has also been restarted back at 1.0.

	     The 'sidebar.html' file was added to the 'RPM Build' as it was not explicitly included in '1.8.1' already.
	     Changed the permissions on 'icinga.log' file to 'howler.howler' after post RPM Build Section.
	     Added a new 'icinga.conf' file to the build to be added to the 'Apache configuration' post install.
	     Added new entries to the 'menu.html' file for 'OpCfg', 'PNP4Nagios', and 'icinga-cgi.log'.

	     Added entry to 'icinga.spec' removing the '.htaccess' file from '/usr/local/icinga/share/log' after the 'mon-icinga-gui RPM' install,
	     opening up access to the 'icinga-cgi.log' file.

	     Modified the 'icinga.spec' file to see if the 'icinga' database already has 'idoutils' installed and to react accordingly.
	     Updated the 'icinga.conf' Apache file to include sample settings for OpCfg & PNP4Nagios.
	     Cleaned up the 'monserver-plugins' tarball to only contain the barebone amount of 'nagios-plugins'.

	     Reconfigured the 'RPM' to copy the current 'check_nrpe' plugin from '/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins' to the '/usr/local/icinga/libexec' directory 
	     if it already exists during the installation.

	   - v2.1
	   - Added the 'status-header.ssi' file to the 'monconfigs' directory which displays the pop-up view of the
